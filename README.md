C and C++ code to perform Quantum Logic Operations 

This is a place for scientific programming in C and C++ targeted at Quantum Logic. 
As many are aware Quantum logic gates and their operations depend on Matrix and Vector Operations. 
Followed by the representation in the Bloch Sphere. 
I would be adding more code related to Quantum logic operations and I encourage others to do the same.
